# ENM-of-Several-Invasives

This is a study being done with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) and the Wersal Lab. The methodology of this study will be similar to the methodology of the ENM of Helianthus repository consisting of downloading then cleaning data, creating climatic layers, and creating niche models using MaxEnt. Where this study differs will be that most data will be accessed through several sources such as USGS Nonindigenous Species Database and USACOE. The species being evaluated are Flowering Rush (Butomus umbellatus), Starry Stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa), and Cuban Bulrush (Cyperus blepharoleptos.) These species are studied by the Wersal Lab and this information will be used for several Masters of Science Theses projects done by Maxwell Gebhart, Alyssa Haram, Patrick Carver, Allison Squires, and Maddie Kjellesvig.
