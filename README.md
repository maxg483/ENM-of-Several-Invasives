# ENM-of-Flowering-Rush

This is a study being done with the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE) and the Wersal Lab. The methodology of this study will be similar to the methodology of the ENM of Helianthus repository consisting of downloading then cleaning data, creating climatic layers, and creating niche models using MaxEnt. Where this study differs will be that most data will be accessed through several sources from the USACOE on locations for diploid and triploid flowering rush. As well as using stream gage data taken from the USGS which will replace the soil grids data from the Helianthus study.
